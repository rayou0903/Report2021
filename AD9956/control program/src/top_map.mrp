  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Place:1206 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <clk_gen/clkout2_buf>, driving the net, <WING_A_13_OBUF>, that is driving the
   following (first 30) non-clock load pins off chip.
   < PIN: WING_A<13>.O; >
   This design practice, in Spartan-6, can lead to an unroutable situation due
   to limitations in the global routing. If the design does route there may be
   excessive delay or skew on this net. It is recommended to use a Clock
   Forwarding technique to create a reliable and repeatable low skew solution:
   instantiate an ODDR2 component; tie the .D0 pin to Logic1; tie the .D1 pin to
   Logic0; tie the clock net to be forwarded to .C0; tie the inverted clock to
   .C1. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was
   applied on COMP.PIN <clk_gen/clkout2_buf.O> allowing your design to continue.
   This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified
   COMP.PIN.
WARNING:Place:1137 - This design is not guaranteed to be routable! This design
   contains a global buffer instance, <clk_gen/clkout2_buf>, driving the net,
   <WING_A_13_OBUF>, that is driving the following (first 30) non-clock load
   pins.
   < PIN: WING_A<13>.O; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. Please pay extra attention to the timing and routing of this path to
   ensure the design goals are met. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN
   <clk_gen/clkout2_buf.O> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   sdram/statep[8]_GND_41_o_Mux_84_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is
   not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into
   the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   measure/data_save/dds2_data[7]_dds2_data[7]_OR_576_o is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   measure/data_save/dds1_data[7]_dds1_data[7]_OR_288_o is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   2 block(s) removed
   8 block(s) optimized away
   2 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal
"rc/fifo_rc/U0/xst_fifo_generator/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.wr/g
was.wsts/ram_full_i" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal
"tr/fifo_tr/U0/xst_fifo_generator/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.wr/g
was.wsts/ram_full_i" is sourceless and has been removed.
Unused block
"rc/fifo_rc/U0/xst_fifo_generator/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.wr/g
was.wsts/ram_full_i" (FF) removed.
Unused block
"tr/fifo_tr/U0/xst_fifo_generator/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.wr/g

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
